## Repository Contents
This repository contains the code required to evaluate the fraudulent transaction on "Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection" dataset utilizing Logistic Regression Model, Random Forest Model, and Gradient Boosted (XGBoost) Regression Model.

# Abstract
## Context
Mobile banking and mobile money are relatively new banking services that have gained popularity with consumers. Mobile banking and mobile money services allow customers to carry out financial transactions remotely using a mobile device (e.g. cell phone, tablet). The innovation in technology and banking services has raised new concerns with security risks and vulnerabilities to be exploited for financial crime and fraudulent activities. Therefore it is crucial for banks to implement effectively fraud detection solutions to prevent potential financial loss to customers and the organizations.

The end goal of the project is to determine the most effective Machine Learning algorithm that is suitable for detecting mobile money fraud transactions. The research work and data analysis should also address the problem statement:  What are the indicators to identify fraudulent transactions or to distinguish fraudulent from non-fraudulent transactions.

## Data
The data analysis will be conducted in Python using the "Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1. This is a synthetic dataset generated by the PaySim mobile money simulator, which resembles the normal mobile money transactions with injected malicious transactions (Lopez-Rojas, 2016).

## Techiniques and Tools
Python is used for examining and comparing three different Machine Learning algorithms for detecting fraudulent transactions - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost.
