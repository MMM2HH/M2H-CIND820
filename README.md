# Abstract
## Context
Mobile banking and mobile money are relatively new banking services that have gained popularity with consumers. Mobile banking and mobile money services allow customers to carry out financial transactions remotely using a mobile device (e.g. cell phone, tablet). The innovation in technology and banking services has raised new concerns with security risks and vulnerabilities to be exploited for financial crime and fraudulent activities. Therefore it is crucial for banks to implement effectively fraud detection solutions to prevent potential financial loss to customers and the organizations.

The end goal of the project is to determine the most effective Machine Learning algorithm that is suitable for detecting mobile money fraud transactions. The research work and data analysis should also address the problem statement:  What are the indicators to identify fraudulent transactions or to distinguish fraudulent from non-fraudulent transactions.

## Data
The data analysis will be conducted in Python using the "Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1. This is a synthetic dataset generated by the PaySim mobile money simulator, which resembles the normal mobile money transactions with injected malicious transactions (Lopez-Rojas, 2016).

## Techiniques and Tools
Python is used for examining and comparing three different Machine Learning algorithms for detecting fraudulent transactions - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. 

### Requirements
- Python 3.0
- Pandas
- Numpy
- OS
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn
- Stasmodel.api
- Scipy.stats
- sklearn
- mpl_toolkits
- LogisticRegression
- RandomForestClassifier

# Study Conclusion
Based on the algorithm model analysis, Random Forest performs better results for detecting fraudulent transactions than XGBoost and Logistic Regression. However, given the results for all three models are very close, one limitation of my analysis is parameter tuning was not performed or experimented to enhance any model performance or improvement. 

In terms of fraud indicators, the dataset shows only transfer and cash-out transaction types contain fraudulent transactions. The number of fraudulent transfers is similar to the number of fraudulent cash-out. One possible explanation is that fraud is often committed by first transferring the funds to one account then subsequently cashed out by another fraudulent account. Another interesting observation is that fraudulent transactions appear to occur in all time and at any amount (below threshold), whereas genuine transactions tend to peak in specific time and the amount transferred appears to be slightly higher for genuine transactions. 

Technology innovation and consumer demands continuously drive changes to bank's operations, product and services. Fraudsters are also continue to discover creative ways to circumvent bank's defences. On top of all these challenges, customer behaviour patterns are diverse thus making it difficult to setup monitoring control to distinguish fraudulent from genuine transactions. As a result, banks are facing the challenges to continually improving their fraud detection solutions. For this reason continuous research work is still required to determine most suitable Machine Learning methodology or techniques that can more effectively and efficiently detect or predict changes with fraud patterns and trends.
